A fashion blog can cover many things such as specific items of clothing and accessories, beauty tips, trends in various apparel markets (haute couture, prêt-à-porter, etc.), celebrity fashion choices and street fashion trends.\[1] They cover fashion at all levels from the largest fashion design houses to the smallest independent designers.\[2]  Many fashion blogs could also be categorised as shopping blogs, similar to the content of fashion magazines. Some retailers in the fashion industry have started blogs to promote their products.\[3]  Some blogs focus more on fashion advice, featuring how-to articles for the lay reader. Articles discuss clothing fit, the matching and complementing of colors, and other information on clothes wearing and care along with prescriptive advice on adhering to basic standards and recent trends.
